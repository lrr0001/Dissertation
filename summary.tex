This dissertation presents a novel convolutional dictionary learning algorithm for signals with a large number of channels. This algorithm uses low-rank updates for the dictionary, so that a matrix decomposition necessary for pursuit can be updated efficiently. In later chapters, this algorithm is applied to multi-layer dictionary models with multi-channel dictionaries and single-channel coefficients, where the number of filters in one layer is the number of channels in the subsequent dictionary layer. This architecture is demonstrated on the task of JPEG compression artifact removal.
